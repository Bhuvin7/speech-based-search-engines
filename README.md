# Voice Interaction Projects Suite

This repository contains three speech-driven projects that showcase the power of voice interaction in modern applications:

1. 🎤 **Speech-Based Search Engine**
2. 🗃️ **Voice-Controlled Data Entry System**
3. 🔐 **Voice-Based Authentication System**

These projects use speech recognition and natural language processing to enable intuitive and hands-free human-computer interaction.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition (Google Web Speech API)
- Pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- Pyaudio / Sounddevice
- NLTK / spaCy (for natural language understanding)
- OpenCV (for face detection in authentication, optional)
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (optional for voiceprint modeling)
- SQLite / CSV / Pandas (for data storage)
- Flask (for web deployment, optional)

## 1. 🎤 Speech-Based Search Engine

This tool allows users to perform online or offline searches using their voice.

### Features:
- Converts speech to text for query input
- Performs web search using the `webbrowser` or custom dataset search
- Optional: Summarizes search results using NLP

### Run:
```bash
cd speech_search_engine
python search_engine.py
````

---

## 2. 🗃️ Voice-Controlled Data Entry System

A simple form filler using voice commands. Useful for hands-free data input in spreadsheets or databases.

### Features:

* Voice input for multiple fields (e.g., name, age, email)
* Saves data to CSV or SQLite database
* Basic error correction for common misrecognitions

### Run:

```bash
cd voice_data_entry
python data_entry.py
```

---

## 3. 🔐 Voice-Based Authentication System

Authenticate users based on their voice (voiceprint + passphrase recognition).

### Features:

* Records a passphrase and extracts voice features (MFCC, pitch)
* Compares against stored voice model (ML-based or template matching)
* Optional face ID integration

### Run:

```bash
cd voice_authentication
python voice_auth.py
```

## ✅ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-interaction-projects.git
cd voice-interaction-projects
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run any module as shown above**

> Note: Ensure you have a working microphone and internet connection for API-based speech recognition.

## 📌 To-Do / Improvements

* Improve speech accuracy using custom language models
* Integrate GUI using Tkinter or web UI using Flask
* Add speaker verification using deep learning
* Export results to Excel or cloud databases
